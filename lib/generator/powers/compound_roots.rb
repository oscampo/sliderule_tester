There are several methods to solve a*sqrt(x), depending on the scales available:
A. Using A and B:
  1. Set 1 on C under a on D,
  2. Read answer on D under x on B.
B. Using C and A (requires transfer to A in most real world calculations):
  1. Place 1 on C over a on Sqrt(x),
  2. Place cursor over x on D,
  3. Read answer on Sqrt(x) under cursor.
C. Using C and D scale (this is equivalent to method B, but takes more steps!)
  1. Multiply as a * a * x, and then take the square root.
