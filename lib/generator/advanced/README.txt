Make problems of various forms encountered in the real world.  Some of which
may involved physics, statistics, etc as the basis, but some of which my just
be random.

It may be that we divide up into several generators and then have a generator
that randomly pulls from a list of generators.  (A random generator generator
would not be in this directory, however).

Ideas:
1. Gravitational/Electric force and potential
2. Escape Velocity
3. Gaussian Distribution Value
4. Projectile motion (could get trig involved here!)
5. Areas/Volumes/Surface of circles and spheres.
6. Thermodynamics
