Generators for trig functions.

* sin, asin, csc
* cos, acos, sec
* tan, atan, ctan

The usage is different for small angles vs large angles!
1. x>5.7 deg, use S or T.
2. 0.57<x<5.7 deg, use SRT
3. x<0.57, convert to radians.

+ Rad to Degree and back conversions.
+ Multiplication with Pi should be thrown in too.


* Conversion to/from polar/rect coordinates.
