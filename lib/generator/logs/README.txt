Generators for Logarithms including:

* ln(x)
* log(x)
* logN(x)
* exp(x)
* 10^x
* N^x (This is really the same as basic powers, except that the emphasis is on
       the exponent be irrational and N being an integer!)

Note: It is important to give negative values of x in exp(x) and 10^x calcs.

Note: The arbitrary base exponents/logs aren't terribly useful, since they are
the same functionality as the arbitrary powers.  However, I divided things
up into doing large exponents that cannot use LL and smaller exponents that can
(and vice-versa for logs).  (Base 2 could be useful, but most people would turn
them into a base 10 or base E problem anyway?)
